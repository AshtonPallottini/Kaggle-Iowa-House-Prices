# Kaggle-Iowa-House-Prices
Using advanced statistical techniques and training data to predict Iowa house sale prices in R.
Goal was to use statistical methods (subset selection, shrinkage, dimension reduction, KNN, nonlinear regression, linear regression, and tree models) in order to predict house sale prices on the Kaggle website. Extensive data cleaning was also included. Project was done as a group, although the code is all mine. Overall, we found that averaging the Principal Component Regression and Partial Least Squares results yielded the best accuracy.
